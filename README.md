TDD Session
==============

An example PHP project (powered by Symfony) in order to learn and practice TDD.

The goal here is to calculate sub matrix with different params such as:
- Horizontal position of the center square
- Vertical position of the center square
- Range / Wide of the sub matrix
 
I tried to following certain patterns as Clean Code Book suggests and TDD.
